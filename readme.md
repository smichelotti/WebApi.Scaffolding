## WebApi.Scaffolding

Web.Api Scaffolding is built on top of [T4Scaffolding](http://nuget.org/packages/T4Scaffolding). 

It behaves similar to MVC Scaffolding which is that it adds PowerShell commands to the NuGet Package Manager console window.
It enables scaffolding of API Controllers with Repositories and more advanced options than what comes built-in to the OOTB MVC tooling.

NuGet location: http://nuget.org/packages/WebApi.Scaffolding
